# DGX Spark Starter Kit (Open Source)

I am coming from Mac, hence Ubuntu is new to me. I hope this helps others who are in my shoes.

This repository collects practical, beginner‑friendly notes and scripts for using an NVIDIA DGX Spark running Ubuntu. The goal is to make your first days on a DGX smooth and productive, whether you're a student, researcher, or engineer.

| --- | --- |
| `ubuntu-basics` | Cheat sheets and tips for using Ubuntu, including keyboard shortcuts, file navigation, screenshot instructions and common aliases. |
| `dgx-setup` | Guides for getting started on DGX hardware: first‑time setup, installing GPU drivers, checking GPU status with `nvidia‑smi`, and monitoring system resources. |
| `python-environment` | Instructions for creating virtual environments, using `pip`, and troubleshooting common Python environment issues on a DGX. |
| `postgresql` | Steps to install PostgreSQL on DGX/Ubuntu, create roles/databases, and connect with DBeaver. |

## Who this is for

* Students learning machine learning or AI on high‑performance hardware.
* Researchers and engineers using DGX workstations or similar GPU servers.
* Anyone coming from macOS or Windows who needs a concise primer on Ubuntu and DGX.

## Experiments

We will be exploring knowledge graphs using the publicly available CMS NPI database—creating the graph, querying it, and documenting learnings as we go.
